# Project-Text-Classification
I have Implement Naive Bayes on my own from scratch for text classification and Compared the Results with built in Multinomial Naive Bayes in Sklearn.

# Features

# Dataset Overview
* The Newsgroup dataset is a collection of documents sourced from various newsgroups on Usenet, a distributed discussion system widely used in the early days of the internet. The dataset is commonly employed for text classification tasks and has been widely studied in the field of natural language processing.
* The dataset comprises documents from different newsgroups such as politics, sports, technology, science, and more. Each document represents a post or article contributed by users to the corresponding newsgroup.
* These documents vary in length and can contain a mix of plain text, HTML formatting, and special characters.
* there are 20 catogries each with more than 500 articles in it.

# Libraries used in python
sklearn, numpy, matplotlib, nltk, string

# Evaluation
* Calculated evaluation metrics(accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, classification report)to assess the performance of the model.

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets:
Used a suitable method to split the dataset into training and testing sets(train-test split from scikit-learn).
